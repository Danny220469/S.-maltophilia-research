# Script for Processing Mugsy Output

This Python script (`align_mugsy.py`) was developed for the manuscript "Comparative Analyses Suggest Genome Stability and Plasticity in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia".

## Description
The script parses a Multiple Alignment Format (`.maf`) file generated by Mugsy. It extracts the core genome alignment blocks (where all genomes are present) and concatenates them into a single FASTA file, with 'N' spacers between the blocks.

## Usage
To run the script, modify the example usage line at the bottom of the file to point to your `.maf` file:
```python
# Example usage:
parse_maf_and_merge_with_N(r"path/to/your/file.maf")
